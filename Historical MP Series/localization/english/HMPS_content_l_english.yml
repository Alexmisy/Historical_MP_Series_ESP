 potato_blight.1.d:0 "A mysterious sickness has infested the potato crops in our country. This could spell immense misery and disorder in the near future"
 potato_blight.1.f:0 "The European Potato Failure was a food crisis caused by potato blight that struck Northern and Western Europe in the mid-1840s. The time is also known as the Hungry Forties. While the crisis produced excess mortality and suffering across the affected areas, particularly affected were the Scottish Highlands and, even more harshly, Ireland. Many people starved due to lack of access to other staple food sources."

 potato_blight.3.t:0 "The Irish Potato Famine"
 potato_blight.3.d:0 "Ireland, already suffering from Malthusian population constraints, is the most potato dependent region in the world. The failure of the potato crop will be apocalyptic in nature. This will surely have ramifications for decades to come."
 potato_blight.3.f:0 "The Irish Potato Famine, was a period of starvation and disease in Ireland from 1845 to 1852 that constituted a historical social crisis which subsequently had a major impact on Irish society and history as a whole.During the Great Hunger, roughly 1 million people died and more than 1 million fled the country, causing the country's population to fall by 20–25% between 1841 and 1871. Between 1845 and 1855, at least 2.1 million people left Ireland, primarily on packet ships but also on steamboats and barques—one of the greatest exoduses from a single island in history."

 potato_blight.7.t:0 "The End of the Potato Blight"
 potato_blight.7.d:0 "The blight has finally abandoned our soil, yet much discontent remains. The people's collective trauma has hardened them and led many to demand change."
 potato_blight.7.f:0 "In 2019, researched found that the blight was caused by HERB-1, which had originated in the Americas sometime in the early 19th century before spreading to Europe in the 1840s. HERB-1 was responsible for the Great Famine and hundreds of other potato crop failures around the world. It wasn’t until the early 20th century that improvements in crop breeding yielded potato varieties that proved resistant to HERB-1 that the infection was stopped in its tracks. Scientists believe that the HERB-1 strain is now extinct."
